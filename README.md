# PictureUmbrella
Picture Umbrella - Screensaver for large format displays and other LCD monitors.

This tool is written for any MS Windows version.
It's designed to run customized bars through a screen to reset pixels of a screen.
This can help preventing defects after long runtime of a display.

The application itself runs two forms. One is for settings, the other is for rhe bars.
The second form is set to stay on top. The bars are empty labels.
The background of the form is green, but form is set to transparency color.
Exact background color code is 0x0001fe01.
If you choose this color for bars, the bars won't be shown.

The program otherwise is very simpel to use. Anything is being stored in an Ini file which will be created once you click on Save.
Have fun!
